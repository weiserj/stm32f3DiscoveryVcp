The files given here in this directory must replace the file of the same name in 
the folder USB_FS_Device_Driver\inc directory of the standard peripheral library.

The original files should not be renamed (because Eclipse renames also the
references in this case). Instead the original files should be coüied to some 
other name (e.g. withan "orig"-extension), afterwards deleted and then the files
given here can be moved. Avoid having the files two times in the system. This is a 
source for obscure errors.
